<p>The weather journal app is an application developed to give the user the current date, the current weather of their zip code ,and display how the user felt about the weather today in neat fashion. </p>

##  Usage
<p>The user is asked to provide the zip code desired and the user has the ability to type in the "How are you feeling today?" area any feelings they would like to express.
the website would log the current date, the temperature of the zip code ,and the feeling the user input down below at the "Most recent entry" area</p>

## Depencencies
<p>The project depends heavily on the helping tips provided by the Udacity project guide as well as documentations provided by Mozilla and w3schools.</p>
